==========

Started the project. Created mesh/world system, AABB collision and physics, world rendering, start of camera system.


2022-07-06
==========

Created physics wireframe drawing, player camera, player input handling, player movement, stair climbing.
Added arm raising after falling a distance > 6 studs
Finished create_mesh(), init_mesh() now uses it


2022-07-07
==========

Switched default mesh to vtx_format 1 - now has normals
Added create_program() for creating a new GL program given shader strings and adding it to a global array
Implemented basic directional lighting using normals
Added texture coordinates to default mesh, and per-face texture toggling support


2022-07-08
==========

Added texture_ids array to brick_t; texture IDs for each face (0 if disabled)
Added texture loading (load_texture_from_file) using stb
Texture binding and sampling added in render(), added stud textures
Shader now scales texture coordinates for all faces of bricks by the brick's scale


2022-07-09
==========

Added toggle for whether or not to repeat textures on each stud of a brick's face
Bricks with gravity but without colliders still fall
Created entities system, player_t is now just an entity



(WIP) Entity chasing and random walking AI
(WIP) Create start of HUD system (show health, which is stored in player_t's entity_t)
